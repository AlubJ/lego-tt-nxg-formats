# lego-tt-nxg-formats
Data formats descriptions for TT's LEGO games of the NXG era.

## What?
Lego games made by Travellers' Tales use their proprietary formats for almost everything so reverse engineering the game and extracting data from it becomes more difficult. However, it was found out that the game's code contains nearly all the info for their data formats. The variable names and types here are taken directly from the game (of course, while also comparing it with real data). The game being reversed is Lego LOTR (Lord of the Rings) for Windows.

Read `Types.md` if you are willing to use the info from this repo!
